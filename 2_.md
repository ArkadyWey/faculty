# Day 2 

## Data science 101
- Speaker - Udara de Silva 

### 1. Intro to dara science 

#### Teams 
Data scientist : machine learning, statistics, prototyping -- clean data and test models
Back end engineer : Database management, software architecture, writign production code -- deploy and scale models 
Commerical project management : business acumnen, client management, team organisation -- managing the relationship between the te4chnical team and client
Front end : Defining useer requirement, building user interface, effective visual presentation -- not always necessary for ml product

- Teams are collaborative 

#### Stages of a project 

- Plan : Product manager works with data scientist to figure out what client needs. Whwat data do tehy have? What is their infrastriucture? What does the inhouse data team do? Decide what the timelines are. Decide what the costs are goign to be.

- Explore : Get the data. Understand if you can solve the problem. Review the feasibility. Determine what type of model could be used going forwards. 

- Model ; Looked at data, cleaned it, preprocessed it. Worked out features to put into model. Test some moodels to find which one works best. Run tests, look at results. Product manager will pull out business value drivers and freport back to cleint. Check if client is happy that this is a scalable solution.

- Deploy : Happy with what has been built. MLEs deplot this into production envireonment. APIs integration. Build monitoriung system to track model performance over time. Understand possible failure points. Perhaps biuld user interface by front end developers.

#### Planning 
How to choose what problem to tackle: 
- Make sure impactful solution 
- Make sure outcomes are actionable - not too many blocks on devivering the solution 
- Tractable questions
- TaCcessible data - can teh data we have solve the problem? Can we get that data on time?

#### Explore
- CAn machine learnign solve the problem? Is it the best solution?
- IS there enough clean data to build an ML algorith,?
- Do plots indicate teh business question can be answered with data?
- BAsically - is the project feasible and is it something we shold go ahead with?

####Â Model 
- Simplest model first 
- BAselines model before bespoke ones 
- EAsily debuggable 
- Diminisning returns - more complicated models require greater effort for smaller imporovements

#### Deployment 
- Do not throw models over the fence 
- Instead, work closely between data science and mle
- Consequences of ineffective handover include - team conflicts, deployment delays, costly downtime.

#### When the project doesn't work

- Early in the project -- try different approach / alternative datasets / help from someone with a similar proejct 
- Later in the project -- stop investign time on ambitious ideas / look for simpler ideas that devliver business value / capitalise on insights obtained so far 
- Always -- Inform the client / be annopying and message the company 

### Case studies 
Previous fellowship plays could happen at any given time projects 

#### Rugby team 
- Understandin how opponents play ahead of games 
- PReviosuly they rewatch games and see how they play manually 
-  Solution was dashboard that uses decision trees to decide what potential

#### Safe route not short route 
- Collect available data usong googles api
- DEvelop a route fiding algorithm that is safe 


### Project management guidelines 
Example : Airline 

#### Planning  
- Background 
- Objective 
- Scope 
- Approach 
- Timeline 
- Risks 
- Assumptions 
- Define baselines 
- Data 
- Client map

#### Project management  
Good project management should: 
- Deliver project in timelines 
- Havea grip of 'where you are' in the projectg 
- Reduce risk of 'dropping the ball'
- Meet client expectations 
- This should be done regularly for a small amount of time 

#### How to devliver a successful project plan 
- Check in with commerical and technical mentor in first week 
- Bullt points of what youd like to do week to week to make sure you deliver project to desired time;liens 
- Show to mentor and ask for feedback 
- Then build an initial plan on gannt chart or slide template 
- This will then be shared to the client in week 1 
- We can then tell the client what we need and when we need it 

- Write a weekly status report 
- What I have done this week 
- What I will do 
- TImeleins whoing where we are in the roadmap in terms of a milestone 
- Risk slide - e.g. risk that we dont get hthis data and if we dont then X will happen\

- Don't spend much time writing presentaitons - use a pre template etc 

### 2. Software architecture 
- Session -- Gergely Imreh 

#### What is software architecture 
- Architecture is the part tht is difficult to change later 
- Architecture is the stuff that you can't google 
- Architecture is the importnat stuff.. whatever that is... 

- Architecture is sort of the shape within which the code fits
    - Structure -- the architecture style -- layered / service oriented 
        - You can discuss structure withoout knowing the business context at all 
        - This is to do with data flow
    - Characteristics 
        - Looking at characterisits help you choose the style 
        - characterisitics are *ilities . e.g. availability / testability /.... 
        - We try to evaluate which of these are important and this helps us choose a structure 
        - This is essentially caled a success criteria 
        - Characeteristics are non-functional requirements 
    - Architectural decisions 
        - Structural rules may be broken or not but this shoud be a conscious choice 
        - For example, only certain layers talk to each other... but this is a rule that can be broken, but this should be a conscious choice 
        - Divergence from the classical structure is called a variance 
    - Design principles 
        - Guidelines that layout details of the preferred method
        - For example, whenever we can we use these apis... 
        - These are not hard rules, but we fill in the gap when we could do other things or this 

#### What do software architects do and possess?
- Make architectural decision 
- Analyswe the archite4cture continuously 
- Keep current with the latest technical trends
- Ensure complicance with decisions 
- Have diverse exposure and experience 
- Have business domain knowledge 
- Possess interpersonal skills 
- Understand and navigate the politics 

#### Laws of architecture 

1. Everythnig in architecture is a trade off 
2. If you identify somoethign that isn't a trade off, it's likely that you haven't discovered the trade off yet
3. Why is more important than how 
4. It depends.. this is the start of the answer to almost all software architecture questions

#### Structure example 
An auction site 

- Bid comes in, then captured, tracked, and analysed 
- Simple means that you can add more easily 
- BAsically the more its built into independent objects the more decoupled it is the mode you can add stuff easily 
- But there is a trade off that you get less information  orr the information is harder to encode 

#### Characteristics examples 

- Operational 
    - speed etc 
- Structural 
    - Complexity etc 

- Apllications only support a few characteristics at a time 
- You pick the most important ones, and youo support those 
- There is no bad architecture, but there is expesnive architecture 
- The key is to identify important characteristics and stick to optimising them
- Don't shoot for the best architecture, shoot foer the least worst
- Architecture is iterative - we start simple and then build

Questions : 
- How do you choose style? 
 
#### Architecture patterns 
Do not not do architecture - you end up with a 'big ball of mud' where components are connected in very bad ways 

Monolithinc 
- LAyered 
- Pipeline 
- Microrkernal

Dsitributed 
- Service basd 
- Event driven 
- Space based 

Monolithinc vs distributed 
- Either single deplooyment of code 
or 
- multiple deployment units connected by remote access protocols 

#### Monolithic example
For example, layered 
- Presentation layer : front end 
- Business layer 
- Persistance layer 
- Database 
Things are separated based on the technical aspect of the project
This is simple.Server with front end abnd back end 
USeful for proof of concept etc.

Good points 
- Simple 

Bad points 
- Modularity 
- If we need to scale 
- Testability 

#### Distributed example 
For exmaple, microservices style 
- User interface, feeding more components, feeding many databases 

Good points 
- More modular 
- Easier to test

Bad points 
- Less simple 
- Not particulalrly scalable 
- Not high performance because a lot of systems are comunicating with each other 

- What architecture is in fashion depends on many things - one important point is that technology and what sorts of things need to be included might make a new fashion favourable 

#### Technique and soft skills 

- Architecture decisiono records - what we have decided and WHY we have decided it. This avoids us dsicussing the decision again later down the line.
- Architecture diagrams - the tpology of a system is imortant to undertsand and diagram is useful way to understand it yourslef and to communicate it to others. 
- Risk assessment - What can go wrong / how would we fix the problem before hand / identification-consensus-mitigation

- Negotiatiohn 
- Facilitation 
- Learning 
- Develop and guide ideas
- USe checklists

'How do we get great designers? Great designers design, of course' - Fred Brooks
 
### Containerisation 
Teacher - Eron Cemal

#### How to deploy apps 
What do we need?
- Dependencies 
- python version 
- Operating system 
- Sysrtem packages 
- CPU and RAM
- GPU 
- Networking -- ports, load balancing 

#### Virtualisationo 
We use virtualisatio to solve the above problems prior to docker. 

- Virtualisation is  away of partiotioning your server when we want too deploy mroe than one app per server.
- These server chucnks are called virtual machines.

Problems with virtualisation 
- Does not scale well 
- VMs do not share resources 
- Developers are not aware of limitations.
- Need to tell person using the app that you need al these thigs to run. 

#### Containerisation 
Key is that we only install the OS once and then the container is just a version of that OS - whereas with virtual  machines we have to install teh whole OS each time. OS is 15GB vs container is around 100MB. 
- Containers can be tested locally via python. 
- Then containers can be sent to deployment team.

#### Docker 
- Docker is considered to be the only container solution (in the same way as git for bversion control) even though there are other options. 
- Docker has started charging coorporations if abovoe certain size and using more than so many images per day.

- DockerFile : recipe to build the imagem - this is a shell script.
- docker build .
- Docker image 
- docker run <image> 
- Docker container

Docker volumes 
- What if you ened to store some sate?

Ports
- If you need to expose a port. 
- By default all of these are closed.

Environment variables 

#### Docker compose 

docker-compose.yml file 

- This defines the containers that we are going to run and the flags that we want to use for each.

#### Hosting docker
simple workflow 
- ssh into virtual machine 
- install diocker 
- biuld image inside using docker compose 
- this makes teh virtual maachine into the container that you want
- question : do you THEN install the package you want to run or is the package part of the container?

cloud integrated workflow 
- this is serverless 
- not proviusiong a vritual server 
- you say here's a container, just run it foro me, using fargate 
- fargate is something similar to yaml file of docker-compose 


####Â Dockerhub
- gitlab and amazon are private versions of dockerhub

#### Docker orchestrators  
- These are tools that help you run docker 

They solver problems in : 
- discoverability 
- autoscaling 
- bin packing 
- distributing containers across multiople servers given CPU and RAM constraints

In order of increasing complexity: 
- docker 
- docker compose 
- docker swarm 
- kubernetes - k8s
